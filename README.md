# Sudoku-Solver-GUI

Welcome to my Sudoku Solver GUI! This project was done to learn about the Java Swing GUI library, how to write event handlers, and to explore the game of Sudoku. After all, I was never the best at Sudoku, so computer to solve them for me.

This document details information on how to run, modify, and explore the code that made this application a reality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java SE 14 or above (https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase/jdk14-archive-downloads.html)
- Git Version Control (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Open up the terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands to check your installation:

- Ensure you have Git installed by running: 

```bash
git --version
```

The above command should return a version number if you have Git installed.

- Check your Java installation by running:

```bash

java -version
'''

```bash
javac -version
```
Both commands should output a version number matching the version selected on Oracle's Java installation. For instance, installing Java SE 14 and running the commands may get you the following outputs. Notice the output "14.0.2" is reasonable since Java SE 14 was version that was installed.
Input:
```bash
java -version
```
Output:
```bash
java version "14.0.2" 2020-07-14
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 14.0.2+12-46)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.0.2+12-46, mixed mode, sharing)
```
Input
```bash
javac -version
```
Output:
```bash
javac 14.0.2
```
